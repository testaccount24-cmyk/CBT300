)F FUNCTION -

  The DA command will display the running ASID's in the system.

)X SYNTAX -

     DA  (with no parameters) - Shows ALL ASIDS except for
                                free initiators

           (This default can be changed by changing the
            flag settings at label GETPDEF.)

     DA  (with parameters)

         PARAMETER  SHOWS          FLAG SETTING
         ---------  -----          ------------
         (NONE)                      X'17'
           A        ALL ASIDS        X'1F'
           S        STC  ONLY        X'01'
           T        TSU  ONLY        X'02'
           J        JOB  ONLY        X'04'
           I        INIT ONLY        X'08'
           X        ATX  ONLY        X'10'

     If this piece of work is a JOB or ATX running under
     an initiator, then an "I" is shown in the display, in
     column 64.

     Status of any address space as JOB, STC, etc. is
     indicated by the CSCB Type Identifier field, CHTRKID.
     The CSCB mapping macro is IEECHAIN in SYS1.MODGEN.

ALIAS    - NONE

  DA will produce an output in the form:

Where:

 JOBNAME  -  is the jobname of the job. (//jobname JOB ...)
 STEPNAME -  is the name of the step on the EXEC PGM= or
             EXEC PROC= card.
 PROCSTEP -  is the name of the step within a PROC if the EXEC
             was of a PROC and not a Program.
 STATUS   -  is a 2 part field in the form:  xx aaaa

             xx = current memory (job/user) status
             IN =  user in core and executing
             NS =  user in core and is non/swappable
             PR =  user in core and is in supervisor state
             WT =  user is swapped out due to WAIT
             S  =  user is swapped out
             <> =  user is being swapped in or out

          aaaa  =  swap reason code for memory (job/user)
          TPUT  =  Terminal output wait swap-out.
          TGET  =  Terminal input wait swap-out.
          LONG  =  Long wait caused swap-out.
          PGS<  =  Auxiliary Storgage (paging space) shortage swap-out.
          RSS<  =  Real Storage pageable pool shortage swap-out.
          WAIT  =  Main Storage Occupancy detected WAIT swap-out.
          RQSW  =  REQSWAP SYSEVENT caused swap-out.
          DENQ  =  CAP Enqueue exchange Swap-out.
          EXCH  =  CAP exchange swap based on recommendation values.
          SWAP  =  CAP unilateral swap-out.

 STEP-TIME - is the elapsed time of the step from initiation.

 STEP-CPU  - is the number of CPU seconds used by the current step.

 ASID      - is the address space ID in HEX.

 I         - is an indicator whether this work is running under
             an initiator.  Free initiators that are not running
             any work are marked as initiators.

)O OPERANDS -
   There are no operands required for the DA command.
   Optional operands are:
