Hi Sam,

You asked me to see if I could fix the CATPW command in CBT file
300, which displays catalog passwords. I tried to fix it but it
turns out that it can't be fixed, because catalogs don't have
passwords any more. The catalog record that CATPW looks at has a
different format, so it puts non-character data in the displayed
results.

I found this in the Managing Catalogs manual:

http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/DGT2C191/2.1.1

 2.1.1 Catalog Rules for Data Managed by the Storage Management
 Subsystem

 You cannot use password protection for catalogs or data sets
 cataloged in a catalog.

 Use z/OS Security Server Resource Access Control Facility (RACF)
 to protect data that is cataloged.

I found this IBM web page that identifies when passwords were dropped.

Alter of Data Set Passwords fails on z/OS 1.5 with RC18 RSN12

Question

Use of IDCAMS to alter any of the passwords for a data set fails
at z/OS 1.5 or higher releases

Cause

In the level of DFSMS supplied with z/OS 1.5 any request to
update the following attributes will result in an IDC3009I
message with return code 18 and reason code 12: ATTEMPTS,
AUTHORIZATION, CONTROLPW, MASTERPW, READPW, UPDATE'S. Password
support for authorization checking was dropped in the level of
DFSMS supplied with OS/390 2.7 thru OS/390 2.9 (DFSMS 1.5, FMID
HDZ11E0). However, internal code was still in place that
permitted updates for systems that were at or below that level so
that data sets could be shared with lower level systems. Starting
with z/OS 1.5 (FMID HDZ11H0), the internal code has been removed
and you will receive the following messages:

IDC3014I CATALOG ERROR
IDC3009I ** VSAM CATALOG RETURN CODE IS 18 - REASON CODE IS IGG0CLE8-12
IDC0532I **ENTRY EXAMPLE.KSDSS0.FILEA NOT ALTERED
IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, HIGHEST CONDITION CODE WAS 8
IDC0002I IDCAMS PROCESSING COMPLETE. MAXIMUM CONDITION CODE WAS 8

Answer

Remove use of the keywords ATTEMPTS, AUTHORIZATION, CONTROLPW,
MASTERPW, READPW and UPDATEPW from IDCAMS input.

Best wishes.
