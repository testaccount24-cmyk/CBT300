              CBT FILE 300  -  CHANGE LOG   (S.Golob)
              --- ---- ---     ------ ---

This member is an attempt to document changes made to source members
on CBT File 300 which is a collection of TSO commands amassed by
Jim Marshall.  Many of these commands were written around 30 years
ago, before XA, or before ESA, or before SMF dataset names could be
44 bytes long, or before the UCB lookups changed to their present
status and methods of operation.

These commands are extremely useful to have for a systems programmer
who is a TSO user.  Sometimes, you can't easily execute a console
command, and these TSO commands make similar information available
under TSO (like really quick).  Most of the fixes necessary for z/OS
were not too difficult to accomplish (like AMODE 31, or macro changes
and so forth).  Bill Godfrey, who wrote many of these commands or
modified them many years ago, has assisted me in making some of the
more difficult corrections necessary for z/OS.

I think that in all cases, I have left the original source in the
present CBT File 300, always under a different, but easily recognizable
name.  This is to help the MVS 3.8 people who run under Hercules,
because the original format of these commands is closer to that
operating system, and the changes necessary for z/OS might ruin
things for MVS 3.8.

In some cases, even though these commands have been fixed to run
under z/OS, there exist better versions of them on other CBT files.
I will attempt to point this out, when I recognize a situation like
that, and I'll try to direct you to the "more modern" versions of
the respective command, or some other command that does a better job.


Summary List of commands that have been changed:

AUCMD, CMDLOFF, COMPRESS, DAJOB, DAPF, DDISK, DLINK,
DLPA, DLVLDSS, DSMF, DSNCHECK, DSVC, DUSER, LASTIPL,
LISTAX, SHOWSS, UADLST, UADS, ZAP.

Command added:  USERS, ACTIVE (same program)

Also CALC.  CALCSUB did not need changing, but compile and
     linkedit JCL, and the driver, CALC, needed changing.

Next wave:  IO (fixed for z/OS)

More detailed description of commands and changes to them:


AUCMD    - TSO command to APF-authorize other TSO commands,
           by ATTACHing the command in an authorized state.
           You only need one entry in the IKJEFTE2 table
           instead of many.  Alias is # for this command.
           So to authorize a command you just have to say:
             # command operands

CALC     - A TSO-based calculator program written in PL/I.

CMDLOFF  - Sets control block bits for imminent LOGOFF,
           after a command gets executed.  Example:
             CMDLOFF LISTA ST HI SYSNAMES
           After the LISTA command is executed, the userid
           is logged off.  Under ISPF, the LOGOFF will be
           delayed until you =X into TSO READY mode.

COMPRESS - Compresses the pds that you are now editing a
           member of.

DAJOB    - Displays a list of active jobs and some of their
           usage stats.

DAPF     - Displays the list of APF authorized libraries.
           (Both static and dynamic APF lists.)

DDISK    - Displays online DASD volumes.
           There are better commands that do the same
           kind of thing.
           UCBDASD from File 731, or ULUDASD from File 873.
           DUDASD from this file is also good.

DLINK    - Display link list libraries.

DLPA     - Display LPA list libraries.

DLVLDSS  - Display the DF/DSS level.

DSMF     - Display SMF dataset status.  Similar to the D SMF
           operator command.

DSNCHECK - Determine if a certain dataset name or PDS member
           is cataloged on this system, and display the result,
           both as a display and as a return code.

DSVC     - Display all the 256 slots in the SVC table.
           (Program SVCTAB from CBT File 133 does a similar job.)
           (Mark Zelden's REXX exec IPLINFO from File 434 will
           also display the extended SVC table entries.)

DUSER    - Tells you which TSO users are active on this LPAR.
           With the ASID parameter, it will also display each
           user's ASID value in hex.

LASTIPL  - Date routine had to be fixed. Tells you when the last
           IPL of this system was.

LISTAX   - Displays all dataset allocations to this session, like
           ISRDDN, but it also tells you each dataset's disposition,
           like (SHR,KEEP,KEEP).

SHOWSS   - Show Subsystems.  Display relevant information in the
           subsystem name table.  Can optionally inactivate a
           subsystem by zeroing out its SSVT (Subsystem Vector Table)
           entry.

UADLST   - Good auditor's tool.  Looks at SYS1.UADS and reports
           the status of each member entry representing a defined
           userid.

UADS     - Directed at a specific userid defined in SYS1.UADS.
           Tells you details about its properties.

USERS    - This program never was here on File 300.  Displays
ACTIVE     TSO users, if you run it as USERS, and displays
           active jobs, if you run it as ACTIVE.

ZAP      - UCLA fullscreen zap program to do AMASPZAP actions
           interactively.  I just put in Greg Price's latest
           version, including disassembly of IBM's newer
           instructions.
