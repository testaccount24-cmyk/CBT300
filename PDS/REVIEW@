Note from Sam Golob about REVIEW in this file (CBT File 300).

It is much better to use REVIEW from CBT File 134 than to use
this version.  REVIEW from File 134 is a vast improvement over
this version, and this version is probably only really good for
historical purposes, compared to the File 134 version (load
modules on File 135).

This REVIEW program was written by Bill Godfrey and submitted to
the CBT Tape after it was written in 1982 (by Jim Marshall).
Meanwhile, in Australia, Greg Price (starting in 1983) began to
improve REVIEW in many increments.  Greg's current version of
REVIEW (which has well over 100 thousand lines of code in several
modules) can browse (AND EDIT) almost any kind of MVS file.  So
it is best to get Greg Price's version of REVIEW (in CBT Tape
File 134 for source code, and load modules in File 135).  Greg's
version of REVIEW also includes the HEL (fullscreen version of
TSO help) program as an alias, instead of as a separate program.
Greg's REVEDIT subprogram of REVIEW allows you to do ISPF-like
EDITs of files, without ISPF, in TSO READY mode, so it is an
excellent recovery tool when ISPF won't come up for some reason
(usually a file allocation problem).

So again, please use REVIEW from CBT Files 134 (source) or 135
(load) instead of REVIEW from this file.  This was the original
version but the File 134 version is much, MUCH better!
