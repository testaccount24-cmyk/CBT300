         NOTES ON THE "USERS" AND "ACTIVE" PROGRAM
         ----- -- --- ------- --- -------- -------

                                    By Sam Golob   -  Aug 2019

     I have been using the USERS TSO command to find out what
TSO users were on the system, for the past 35 years or more.  I
could not find any source code for it, however.  Furthermore, I
could never figure out why its main CSECT was called ACTIVE and
not USERS.

     When I still had the use of the STARTOOL disassembler with
the REASM keyword, I prepared a disassembled source deck with the
proper assembly and linkedit JCL.  Mind you that the linkedit date
on the program was 1980.

     I started working on the ACTIVE csect, and tried to run it as
the ACTIVE command.  It got a S0C4, and then I figured that it
should run AMODE 31.  I changed the source code to AMODE 31 and the
linkedit JCL as well, and it got a S40A-08 abend.  This meant that
the program was trying to FREEMAIN some storage in Subpool 0, so I
went to the disassembled source and converted the last SVC 10 in
the program to a NOP.  The program worked fine.

     I decided to give the program an alias of ACTIVE to see what
would happen, and I was surprised (out of my mind) that a "Display
Active" display appeared, and not a display of the TSO users.  So
the program actually had a dual purpose, which I was unaware of for
35 years......  It displayed both TSO users, or ACTIVE jobs,
depending on how you ran it.  It used the PUTLINE interface for
output as well, so you can capture the output of both program
modes.

     So there.  The linkedit step should show a load module of
USERS and and an alias of ACTIVE.  Then it can display both things.

     Now the S0C4 made perfect sense, because a "Display Active"
type of program has to run the CSCB chain, and the CSCB chain is
now above the 16 Megabyte line.  Therefore AMODE 31 is necessary,
although it did not exist when the program was first written.

     Therefore, the source code was changed to:

ACTIVE   CSECT
ACTIVE   AMODE 31
ACTIVE   RMODE 24

     And therefore, the linkedit JCL is now as follows:

//LKED.SYSLIN  DD *
 INCLUDE SYSLIBX
 ORDER   ACTIVE,PARMS
 MODE    RMODE(24),AMODE(31)
 SETCODE AC(0)
 ENTRY   ACTIVE
 ALIAS   ACTIVE
 NAME    USERS(R)

The program can be run either as the command of ACTIVE or the
command of USERS.  They have the same entry point.

     I have (I think) fixed the source so that the STEPNAME in
ACTIVE displays properly.  A couple of fields in the CSCB seem
to have gotten moved over the years.

     I have also modified the disassembled source to fix the LA,
L, LH and ST instructions which used the index register improperly,
as the displacement.  I think I got most of them.  Example

     LA    R10,1(R10)        and the like.....

was replaced with

     LA    R10,1(,R10)       the way it should be.

     Before ESA, it didn't matter, but now it does matter.  Might
as well do it correctly.  You can see where I did it, because the
machine code on the right side of the source does not match the
assembly source code in those instructions.  Also look at member
USERSC1 in this pds, where I've detailed the changes in the source
code from the original (member USERS00--not to be used on z/OS).

     I also had an issue at +EFE where the author tried to clear
the high-order BYTE of R1 using an LA instruction, which doesn't do
that in 31-bit mode.  So I replaced it with an MVI  0(R1),X'00'
that seemed to solve the problem.  I checked for other such cases,
but there don't seem to be any.

     There doesn't seem to be an issue with 8-character userids.
I think the program gets the userid from the CSCB, which has an
8-character slot for the jobname.  The PSCBUSER field doesn't seem
to be used at all.  The program treats a TSO user as a jobname, and
jobnames (in the CSCB or elsewhere) always had 8 characters.

Additional note:

     I have tried to improve the disassembled source by replacing
all of the fields addressed by the base registers R11 and R10 by
labels.  Maybe it will be easier to modify the program because of
this.  The program is re-entrant, and the GETMAINed area has still
not been mapped.  (Addressed by R13.)

     Member USERS is now the best source code, and USERS01 is the
previous version, which I got to work on z/OS.
