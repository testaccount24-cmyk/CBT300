)F FUNCTION -
  THE UADLST COMMAND WAS CONVERTED FROM THE UADLIST BATCH PROGRAM,
  (FROM CBT FILE 316) INTO A TSO COMMAND.  ITS FUNCTION IS TO SHOW
  YOU WHAT MEMBERS ARE IN SYS1.UADS, AND WHAT THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
  ARE.  THIS GIVES YOU AN INDICATION OF WHAT USERIDS ARE DEFINED IN
  SYS1.UADS.

  SOME OF THOSE USERIDS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DEFINED TO YOUR SECURITY
  SYSTEM (E.G. RACF), AND THEREFORE THEY MIGHT BE USED AS BACKDOORS
  TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE MVS (Z/OS) SYSTEM.  THIS TSO COMMAND WILL
  SHOW THOSE USERIDS TO YOU.

  THIS COMMAND MIGHT BE USEFUL AS AN AUDITOR TOOL, OR AS A SECURITY
  TOOL.

  THIS COMMAND WAS CONVERTED TO USE PUTLINE TERMINAL OUTPUT, SO ITS
  OUTPUT CAN BE TRAPPED USING SYSOUTTRAP.
