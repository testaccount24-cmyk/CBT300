         Notes about installation of the CALC TSO command
         ----- ----- ------------ -- --- ---- --- -------

Under z/OS, the CALCI41 member should be a model for JCL to install
the CALCSUB TSO command.

If you have older systems, you can use Jim Marshall's original JCL,
or if your system is pre-LE, and you have the 1.4.0 or 2.3.0 PL/I
compilers, then I have included model JCL suited for them.

Install instructions:

For z/OS, compile CALCSUB with the CALCI41 JCL as a model.
Then assemble the CALC driver program with the CALC$ JCL.

For older systems, depending on what PL/I compiler you have,
adjust the old driver program, and use either CALCINS or CALCINS1
as a model.  The driver program's AMODE and RMODE may have to be
changed to match CALCSUB's attributes.  To make the CALC driver
program reusable, insert the instruction XC SAVE,SAVE after the
USING instruction.

------------>  Important note.

Before executing the CALC or CALCSUB TSO commands, you have to
allocate the SYSIN and SYSPRINT DD names to the terminal:

   ALLOC F(SYSIN) DA(*)
   ALLOC F(SYSPRINT) DA(*)

------------>

This TSO-based calculator program was written in PL/I.  Its source
code is member CALCSUB in this pds.  PL/I, being a high-level
language, is subject to the vagaries of how IBM changes the compiler.
Therefore, its installation is dependent on the level of operating
system that you are running.

Thankfully, the source code for the calculator did not have to change.

Jim Marshall wrote an assembler driver for the CALC program, which
was designed to avoid bad-sounding messages when doing normal program
execution.  This was needed for the old version of the CALCSUB code,
using older versions of the PL/I compiler.

I'm not sure if Jim's assembler frontend for CALCSUB needs to be
executed nowadays.  I have updated it for modern LE-based PL/I
compilers, while his old version has been renamed as CALCO.

It seems to me that you can simply execute the TSO command as CALCSUB
directly, and it seems to work.  Of course, if you have an old
operating system like MVS 3.8J, you should install the old code.  Old
code is marked with a "O" in the member name.

Good luck.
