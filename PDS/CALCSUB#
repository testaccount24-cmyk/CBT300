Notes about installation of CALCSUB.....

CALCSUB, being a PL/I program, requires the PL/I Optimizing Compiler
 at some level.  Various flavors of compile JCL have been supplied
 here, depending on which level of PL/I compiler you may have
 available at your installation.  If you have one of the in-between
 releases of the PL/I optimizing compiler, then perhaps you can adapt
 one of the supplied JCL compile jobs to your level.

The following jobs are compile jobs at the following levels:

CALCIN14   -  PL/I Optimizing Compiler 1.4.0
CALCIN23   -  PL/I Optimizing Compiler 2.3.0
CALCLE41   -  PL/I Optimizing Compiler LE - 4.1.0

In order to run the calculator, files SYSIN and SYSPRINT should
be preallocated to the terminal.  This is probably done most
easily using a CLIST.  So the CLIST called CALC@ has been provided,
and it may be renamed to a more convenient name if you wish.
