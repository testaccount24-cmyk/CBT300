This is an updated version of the ZAP command.  It has been updated
to allow the specification of a blocksize on the command to avoid the
blocklen greater than bufflen message.  The most significant change
is the elimination of the need for the ALLOCDSN keyword.  This has
been accomplished by changing the program to use SVC 99 instead of
DAIR.  To support this, a new macro (DYNALC) is included, whose
purpose is to generate the SVC 99 parameter lists required.  The help
member has also been updated to reflect these changes.

So it is now possible to specify a volume with the VOL(vvvvvv) keyword.
