Changes for the IO TSO command:

The IO TSO command will show you I/O counts for all allocated
files in your TSO session, which have any I/O activity against
them.  In other words, if there were I/O's against a DD name or
a file in its concatenation, then the IO command will show you
how many of them there were.


Sample run of the IO command:

Change summary:

1.  The command as found on CBT File 300 (member IOOLD now)
    did not produce intelligible or accurate results on z/OS.
    Bill Godfrey fixed it up (member IO01), and the results
    matched what I was able to display by other means (Greg
    Price's IMON vendor product, option J).

    Bill suspects that the new version of IO will not work
    for MVS 3.8.  Therefore I am leaving the original version
    out there, as member IOOLD.

2.  Member IO01 only does TPUT's, and therefore its output
    is not trappable.  I added Jim Elsworth and Howard Dean's
    gimmick (macro APUT and module EPUTL) to the code, and
    converted all the TPUT's to PUTLINE's (via macro APUT).
    Now the output is trappable and the command is more
    convenient to use  (SG - 10 May 2013).

3.  Older version of IO doesn't show dataset names for each
    concatenation.  Newer version does.  Thanks Bill.
    This is member IO03.

4.  PUTLINE-d version of IO03.  (SG)
