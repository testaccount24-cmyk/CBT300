)F FUNCTION -
  THE 'TO' COMMAND SENDS A MESSAGE TO A USER AT ANOTHER TERMINAL.

  IT DIFFERS FROM THE 'SEND' COMMAND IN THAT THE TEXT OF THE
  MESSAGE IS NOT IN QUOTES, SO YOU DONT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
  DOUBLING QUOTES CONTAINED IN YOUR TEXT. ALSO, THIS COMMAND
  CANNOT PUT A MESSAGE IN THE USER'S BROADCAST MAIL.
)X SYNTAX  -
         TO     'USERID'   MESSAGE
  EXAMPLES - TO JONES WHERE'S THAT REPORT?
             TO (SMITH JONES) LET'S TEST IT.

  REQUIRED - USERID, MESSAGE
  DEFAULTS - NONE
  ALIAS    - NONE
)O OPERANDS -
  'USERID'  -  ONE OR MORE USERIDS, TO WHOM THE MESSAGE IS
             TO BE SENT.
  'MESSAGE' -  THE TEXT OF THE MESSAGE.

))NOTES

1.  If you execute TO under ISPF, your message must have an
    even number of quotes.  ISPF always checks for this.
    So this version of TO will replace two adjacent single
    quotes in a message, by one quote, as follows:

    TO USERID Don''t eat the daisies

    is sent as:

    Don't eat the daisies  USERID

2.  If you are in TSO READY mode, then you can send:

    TO USERID Don't eat the daisies

    and it will be sent as:

    Don't eat the daisies  USERID

3.  Under ISPF, if you issue the command:

    TSO TO USERID Don't eat the daisies

    then you will get:

    ISPD289  Mismatched quotes - The string contains an
             uneven number of quotes

    So to get around that, you have to issue:

    TSO TO USERID Don''t eat the daisies

    and it will be sent as:

    Don't eat the daisies  USERID

4.  Under some ISPF command lines, the entire command is
    uppercased before it is sent, so that:

    TSO TO USERID Don''t eat the daisies

    is sent as:

    DON'T EAT THE DAISIES  USERID

    So please be aware of that possibility.  It depends on
    which ISPF command line your are issuing the command from.
