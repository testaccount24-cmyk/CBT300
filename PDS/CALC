         TITLE 'TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM DRIVER'
*-------------------------------------------------------------------*
*        THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO CALL THE TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM.   *
*        WROTE IT BECAUSE WHEN THE CALC PROGRAM WAS EXECUTED LIKE A *
*        TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR AND A NASTY MESSAGE WAS PRODUCED     *
*        ( IBM003I ). IT DID NOT HURT BUT IT LOOKED AWFUL, DIRTY,   *
*        AND MADE THE USERS BELIEVE SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THIS IS    *
*        THE WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THE MSG.       JIM MARSHALL          *
*        ---------------------------------------------------------- *
*        I DON'T KNOW IF THIS PROGRAM IS NECESSARY WITH LE-LEVEL    *
*        PL/I.  BUT I UPDATED IT ANYWAY (SBG - 2013/05/05).         *
*        CHANGES WERE TO ZERO OUT THE SAVE AREA WITH EACH RUN,      *
*        SO AS TO MAKE THE PROGRAM SERIALLY REUSABLE, LIKE THE      *
*        CALCSUB LOAD MODULE, AND ALSO TO MAKE AMODE 31 AND         *
*        RMODE ANY, LIKE THE MODERN VERSION OF THE CALCSUB LOAD     *
*        MODULE (COMPILED WITH LE-LEVEL PL/I).                      *
